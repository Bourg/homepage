                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                Hey there, I'm Austin!
                I recently graduated the University of Maryland with degrees in computer science and Germanic studies, and now I'm working as a software engineer on the flights team at TripAdvisor's beautiful headquarters in Needham, Massachusetts.
                As you have probably guessed from the... <em>rugged</em> aesthetic of this site, I am something of a backend guy.
                I'm obsessed with type systems, functional programming, accessible computer science education, and my own ineptitude at frontend development.
                Yeah, about that...

                <h3>What is this 90's garbage site, anyway?</h3>
                <p>
                I know what you're probably thinking - this guy is a software engineer at a billion dollar travel site and this is the best personal homepage he can muster?
                Why yes, it is! Allow me to explain...
                </p>

                <p>
                Since I first sunk my teeth into programming in the 9th grade, I've been attracted to the inner workings of every tool in my toolchain to a truly unhealthy degree.
                When I worked for various Minecraft servers in late high school and early college, I found myself less enamored with making shiny minigames and more drawn to improving the infrastructure minutia that made the system tick - stuff like realtime menus and generalizable APIs to bring lightweight coherence to the many disunified minigames (I know, I'm just as fun as parties as you'd guess).
                I was probably the only sicko in my operating systems class that actually found kernel code to be anything more than the obtuse concern of a few bearded geniuses.
                In college I got sucked into teaching, undergraduate research, and graduate courses, but not in shiny, hip areas like machine learning or big data, but rather programming language theory, type systems, and symbolic execution - you know, real practical, everyday stuff.
                Hell, the first time I tried to play around with frontend web development, I just got wrapped up in the inner workings of every Node.js plugin and jQuery selector to the point that I never actually created <em>anything</em>.
                Even hearing friends who work in frontend rattle off the never-ending list of modern frontend tools makes me physically sick to my stomach.
                </p>

                <h4>Enter the project that is this website</h4>
                <p>
                I would like to consider this (currently abysmal) website the first step in forcing myself to learn proper web development and, true to form, I will be starting with the absolute raw basics and working my way up.
                For now there will be no CSS, no templates, and certainly no frameworks.
                In fact, this first version is nothing but a single statically-served HTML document that I typed up in a few hours, but I'm publishing it in this state for two reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>I want work on something that feels real, even if nobody but me is really reading it</li>
                    <li>I want to show all of the warts of learning a new skill, even as an experienced programmer</li>
                </ul>
                My hope is that anybody reading this site when it finally is something to be proud of will be able to see that it wasn't created by some genius of design, but rather by a guy named Austin who started out knowing next to nothing about the entire idea of web development.

                <h3>What's next?</h3>
                <p>
                In keeping with the idea that this site is a public tool for me to learn on, I have a rough plan of how I will leverage it along my journey towards understanding modern web development.
                My ideas range from basic to experimental, but currently are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Style the site with CSS</li>
                    <li>Add some form of linting</li>
                    <li>Add some dynamic elements with JavaScript and jQuery</li>
                    <li>Use Node.js for more than static serving</li>
                    <li>Switch to proper HTML templating engine</li>
                    <li>Integrate a reactive framework for modern cross-platform support</li>
                    <li>Switch everything to TypeScript or Elm</li>
                    <li><strong>Warning! Fearless Idea:</strong> Make the website viewable by commit version so my failures are forever readily viewable</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                These ideas are sure to change as I learn the realities of what I've started, but for now that's my plan.
                Well, that plus keeping the actual content of the site up to date with my own content, my career, and the project of the site itself.
                It wouldn't be much of a personal site if there were no personal content, now would it?
                </p>
                <p>
                Here's to a strange trip into the frontend!
